# DSP Project

This is my Dissertation project called Designing an information iOS application about UWE.

# What is the problem?
- The infrastructure of a university campus is quite complicated. 
- New university students will struggle to find their way around in finding the correct building. 
- Not a lot of on-going support in finding their location.

# How did I resolve it?
- Produced an iOS application that will help new UWE students around campus
- Give facts about the UWE buildings, caterings and what UWE offers
- Voiceover and language features for international students
- Provided links to useful information to the UWE website about the specific topics
